# SNAP2: Critical Care Unit bed availability and postoperative outcome
R &amp; Stata code for conducting the analyses contained within the SNAP 2 study: Critical Care Unit bed availability and postoperative outcome â€“ a multinational cohort study.   
The analyses were run using R Version 4.0.3 in RStudio Version 1.2.5033 & Stata Release 17.    
The order for the scripts is as follows: 
1. SNAP2_IV_Main_Analyses_Github.Rmd
2. SNAP2_IV_Sensitivity_Analyses_Github.Rmd    
Stata scripts need to be run alongside these R markdown files - the relevant scripts to be run are indicated at the relevant points in the markdown files. This dependency is because some of the dataframes used in the Stata scripts are created during the course of the markdown files, and some of the results generated by the Stata scripts are used in the markdown files (e.g. for plotting of results).
